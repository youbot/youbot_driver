     * @brief This DataObject is a Lock-Free implementation,
     * such that reads and writes can happen concurrently without priority
     * inversions.
     *
     * When there are more writes than reads, the last write will
     * be returned. The internal buffer can get full if too many
     * concurrent reads are taking to long. In that case, each new
     * read will read the element the previous read returned.
     *
     * @verbatim
     * The following Truth table applies when a Low Priority thread is
     * preempted by a High Priority thread :
     *
     *   L\H | Set | Get |
     *   Set | Ok  | Ok  |
     *   Get | Ok  | Ok  |
     *
     * legend : L : Low Priority thread
     *          H : High Priority thread
     *          Blk: Blocks High Priority thread (bad!)
     *          internal::NA : Not allowed !
     * @endverbatim
     * Further, multiple reads may occur before, during and after
     * a write operation simultaneously. The buffer needs readers+2*writers
     * elements to be guaranteed non blocking.
